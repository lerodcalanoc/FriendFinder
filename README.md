 A compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from  users' surveys, then compare the answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. The app used Express to handle routing and it's deployed to Heroku.
 
 # How the app works:
 
  * The survey has 10 basic questions . Each answer is on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question.
  * Once you've found the current user's most compatible friend, it will display both the name and picture of the closest match.
  
# Technology and Packages used:
    Node.js

    Express

    Heroku
